# Bevy Boids

Hacked a small prototype for boid simulation in Bevy. Currently only implements the three base rules for boid simulation:
- Separation
- Alignment
- Cohesion

### To Do
- Reorganizing code into different files
- Bevy UI to tune parameters
- Adding sprite to the boxes
- Adding rotation to the boids
